# NBA-Player-Motion-Evaluation
To evaluate NBA players via their motion during the game

This code utilizes the NBA SportVU data to describe the player and team during the game, including 
i) single player's moving route, 
ii) his relative position with teammates, oppnents and ball, 
iii) the play maker during the possession. 
iv) the cooperation of the team.

It aims to provide a more comprehensive evaluation on the player, team and game, potentially making predictions on the outcome of a game. 

The work bases on the previous work, which provides the visulization of the NBA SportVU data:
